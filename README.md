## Summary:

The goal of the challenge was to predict the returns vs. bitcoin of clusters of cryptoassets. 

My global approach was to implement a stacked regression model, containing three base models: XGBoost, RandomForest and LightGBM regressors.
For this challenge, I have achieved the 11th place out of the 51 participants.
